      //Immediately invoked functions run themselves immediately, and they
      //create a scope for a variable. Before let and const this was the only way 
      // to make sure your variable did not get overwritten

// (function(){
// var name = "larry"
// console.log(name)
// })();
{
    const name = "sue"
    console.log(name)
}
// let and const will fix a for loop 
for (var i=0; i < 10; i++){
// console.log(i)
// above will log 1-10
setTimeout(function(){
    console.log('the number is ' + i);
}, 10000)
      }
// in the ammmount of time it takes to run the for loop will have already run and the function will
//log "10" because the variable will have been overwritten

// if you use let it will work because the variable is block scoped, const will not work
//because it will reassign itself
