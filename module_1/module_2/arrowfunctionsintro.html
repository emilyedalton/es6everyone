//aarow functions have a few advantages 
// more concise 
//implicit returns 
//does not rebind the value of "this"

//going to use a function to add a last name string to the pharase below
const names = ['larry', 'joe', 'jack']
const name = "when no one is around, say baby I love you"
// using map with a regular function 

const fullnames=names.map(function(name){
return `my name is ${name}`

})
console.log(fullnames)

//rewritten as an arrow function 
// also note that you do not need to enclose the argument in parens if there is 
// only one agrument
const fullnames2 = names.map(name =>{
    return `my name is ${name} !`


})
console.log(fullnames2)

// aarow functions don't need to have return written
// put the return and the function all up on one line with the function and delete the 
// curly brackets; if you do not delete the curly brackets you get undefined. 
const fullnames3 = names.map(name =>`my name is ${name} ! I mean it this time. `)
console.log(fullnames3)


// if you have no arguments at all you need to pass an empty paren

const fullnames4 = names.map(()=>`I mean it this time. `)
console.log(fullnames4)

//aarow functions are always anonomys functions

// what is a named function? A named function is written with the word "function"

function sayMyName(name){

console.log(name)
}
sayMyName(name)

// if you use an arrow function you cannot name them

const sayMyName2 = (name)=>{console.log(name)}
sayMyName2("Beyonce")

// More aarow function examples!!!

const race = "100m dash"

const winners = ["joe", "dude", "some lady"]
// a better way to indicate the above is to return an object
// pass in two arguments-- the winner and the index
// without paranthesis around the object, it throws an error. But how to 
// make an implicit return that is an object without curly brackes? 
//ANSWER: put them in parenthesis 
const win = winners.map((winner, i ) =>({name: winner, race: race, place: i + 1}))

const ages = [22,45,456,2, 63]

const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 45)
console.log(old)
