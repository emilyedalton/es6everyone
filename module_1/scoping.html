     // scoping means where are these variables available to me. Var variables are functional scope. They are only availabe within the function that they are created, 
     // or if they are not created within a function they are available globally, on the window.

    //below var with will throw an error. THe curly brackets hold the variable inside of them. Like function jail.

     // example of scoping problem 
    // the dogyears variable was created in order to act as a container for the dogyears. But, because 
    // it isn't inside of a function it is available globally 
     var age = 100;
     if (age > 12){
         var dogyears = age * 7; 
         console.log(`you are ${dogyears}dog years old`)
     }

// the above is a great example of when to use "let" instead of "var". Let is block scoped.
//what is block scoping? anytime you see an opening and closing curly bracket that is a block. 
// let is only available in a block scope. 

// you can also use const above because it is also block scoped. 
     let height = 200;
     const key= 'abc123'
